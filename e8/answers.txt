Q1: KNN model is able to do the best job. One of reasons why KNN model is able to do a more accurate job, 
	is because we can specific the number of training point the model must compare making a decision. 
	I chose to use 10 nearest neighbour as it makes the sample large enough 
 
Q2: Yes, the model seems to make resonable mistakes, since some cities might have similar whether conditions hence confusing the model. 
	Adding geographical data such as latitude, longitude, elevation might aid our model in making better decisions.
