Q1: Daily temperatures is not exaclty a reliable way to predict population density, because all cities are different in one way or the other. 
	Some have too many trees, too much polution, elevaltion, too many different factors affecting the daily temperature. 
	But if we have set of cities a great number of similarities daily temperature could a good way predicting population density.
    
Q2: It better to be working with a large data file, it can be hard on your device's memory by taking up most of the space which can lead to slowing down ur pc/equipment or running out of space.
	having a compressed file saves us from that trouble when we can extract the data whenever we need it, it also prevents from getting important data corrupted accidentlty. 
	Hence, its better to work with compressed data which we can decompress on the go rather than uncompressed data.
