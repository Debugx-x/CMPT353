Q1: Using the tests chi2 squares and mannwhite u we get o-values to be greater that 0.05, hence we dont have to reject our null hypothesis.
	Therefore we are not p-hacking
 
Q2: If we would have done t-tests for each pair of sorting algorithm, we would have to do (7*6)/2 = 21 tests. here, m = 21 and for 21 tests, 
	the p value will be < 0.05/21 = 0.0023.
  
Q3: Sorting sorting implementations by speed we can rank from fastest to slowest as partition_sort, qs1, qs2, qs3, qs4, qs5, merge1. 
	The pairs that our tests couldn't distinguish are qs2 and qs3 with identical average speed of 0.061 and, 
	qs4 and qs4 with identical average speed of 0.064
