Q1: While LOESS smoothing is able to adapt to dataset smoothly making the graph look a lot smoother compared to Kalman, 
	its not able to recognise the outliers in the data and often results in LOESS ignoring them in order to achieve it's smooth curve.
	Whereas Kalman smoothing is excellent at smoothing any dataset big or small easily given that we have enough information to make our predictions.
    
Q2: I believe observations such as speed and direction could have allowed us to develop a better kalman filter. 
	By using these information we could created a better transition matrix to predict the next lat/long instead of assuming current and next lat/long and same.
	Using the basic formula of velocity on the basis of speed and direction -> we could have tried to predict what the next lat/long co-ordinate in the given interval of time.
